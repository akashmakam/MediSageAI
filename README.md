##I have used maximum tokens allowed by Lite, so the bot is not currently working.

A web-based AI health assistant powered by **IBM Watson** and **Flask**.

This project was created as part of the **AICTE ‚Äì Edunet IBM SkillsBuild Internship**, a program focused on developing practical skills in AI, cloud computing, and responsible tech development.

The goal was to address real-world healthcare challenges using cutting-edge tools and promote ethical, scalable AI solutions for public good. The Health Symptom Checker is especially relevant today, where early awareness and accurate information can save lives.

## üß† Problem Statement

**Problem Statement No. 28 ‚Äì Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker**

The challenge was to build an Agentic AI-powered health assistant that helps users understand their symptoms by providing:

- ‚úÖ Probable causes  
- ‚úÖ Preventive advice  
- ‚úÖ Care recommendations  

The system retrieves verified medical data from trusted sources such as:

- WHO (World Health Organization)  
- Government health portals  
- Peer-reviewed medical journals  

Users can input symptoms in natural language (e.g., _‚ÄúI have a sore throat and fever‚Äù_). The AI agent responds with:

- Possible conditions  
- Urgency level  
- Home remedies  
- When to consult a doctor  

The assistant also supports **multi-language interaction** and avoids self-diagnosis risks by offering **educational** and **referral-based** suggestions.  
This promotes **early detection**, reduces **misinformation**, and empowers users to take **informed health actions**.

> üí° **Note:** Use of **IBM Cloud Lite services** and **IBM Granite AI model** is **mandatory** as per the problem statement.
